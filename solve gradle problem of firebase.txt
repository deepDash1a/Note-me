Had this same issue. What worked for me was adding this to my android/app/build.gradle file:


configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        eachDependency {
            if ((requested.group == "org.jetbrains.kotlin") && (requested.name.startsWith("kotlin-stdlib"))) {
                useVersion("1.8.0")
            }
        }
    }
}
